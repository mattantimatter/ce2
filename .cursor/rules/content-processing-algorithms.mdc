# content-processing-algorithms

The web content processing system implements specialized algorithms for extracting, summarizing, and managing web content through multiple stages:

## Content Extraction System
Path: src/app/api/chat/services/websiteContent.ts

1. Readability Implementation
- Advanced content extraction using Mozilla's Readability algorithm
- Strips non-essential page elements while preserving key content structure
- Maintains semantic relationships between content blocks
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Content Summarization
- Integrates Google's Gemini model for intelligent content summarization
- Processes extracted content to generate concise, contextually relevant summaries
- Handles multiple URL processing in parallel
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Length Management
- Implements smart content truncation algorithms
- Preserves content integrity while meeting size constraints
- Manages content distribution across multiple processing chunks
Importance Score: 75/100

## Integration Points

1. Multi-URL Processing
- Parallel content extraction from multiple sources
- Maintains content relationships across different URLs
- Aggregates related content for unified processing
Importance Score: 80/100

2. Content Transformation
- Converts raw web content into AI-processable formats
- Preserves essential metadata during transformation
- Handles different content types and structures
Importance Score: 70/100

Key Features:
- Intelligent content extraction preserving semantic structure
- Model-based summarization using Gemini
- Parallel processing architecture
- Content length optimization algorithms
- Multi-format content handling

Overall Content Processing Importance Score: 90/100
